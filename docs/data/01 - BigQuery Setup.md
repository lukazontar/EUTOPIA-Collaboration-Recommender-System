# BigQuery Setup

BigQuery is used as the main data storage and processing engine. It is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse that
enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. It is highly available and secure, and it is fully integrated with the
Google Cloud Platform.

We create a project in Google Cloud Platform named: `collaboration-recommender`.

To set up BigQuery, we run all the queries available in the `bigquery` directory starting with the outermost queries
first.
