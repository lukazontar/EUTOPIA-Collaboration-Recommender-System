/*
FCT_AFFILIATION_BY_DATE
This view calculates the affiliation of ORCID_IDs on a monthly basis.

HAS_EUTOPIAN_AFFILIATION:
    Author has to be employed at a EUTOPIA-an affiliation in the same month or employment start date is null.

    -> Assumption: Publication happens in the following 12 months of working at a university.
    This means that the author is not necessarily working at the university at the time of publication, but has to be employed there within the prior 12 months.
    This assumption is used due to the fact that the publication comes with delay and the author might have left the university before the publication date.
    We filter author to still work here or has worked here within the 12 months before publication.

HAS_NON_EUTOPIAN_AFFILIATION:
    Author has to be employed at a non-EUTOPIA-an affiliation in the same month or employment start date is null.

    -> Assumption: Publication happens in the following 12 months of working at a university.
    This means that the author is not necessarily working at the university at the time of publication, but has to be employed there within the prior 12 months.
    This assumption is used due to the fact that the publication comes with delay and the author might have left the university before the publication date.
    We filter author to still work here or has worked here within the 12 months before publication.

-- 4. The EMPLOYMENT_START_DT and EMPLOYMENT_END_DT are NULL -> no input, meaning that our best guess is that the author always worked here
